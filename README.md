# gobrew

This is an attempt to set up a controller for my brew process on a raspberry PI

Goals for now:
- Support *my* equipment / setup
  - Tilt hydrometer
  - 433mhz remote control outlet switches
  - Grainfather connect
  - Brewfather app
- Control fermentation process (through recipes from Brewfather)
- Control mashing process (through recipes from Brewfather)
- GraphQL API
- Web/JS UI

I'm using golang since I wanted to test it out

Not ready for consumption by anyone yet (not even me)!
